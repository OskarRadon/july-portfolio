# Portfolio Site July Redesign
I figured my portfolio needed a redesign and my projects needed more descriptions so I re-built it from scratch!

## Technologies/Libraries Used
Jade, SCSS, Greensock, Gulp & Node, Bourbon Neat, Prismjs, Slick, jQuery

## Setup
 1. First make sure you have node and gulp installed `node -v` and `gulp -v` and if necessary install em!
 2. Then download or clone this repository and navigate to it, for example `cd Sites/july-portfolio`
 3. Install the node modules: `npm install`
 4. Run the gulp task: `gulp`
 5. The site should open in your browser! If you have any questions or if anything is broken, [email me](mailto:hi@oskarradon.com)! 

## Some cool features:
 - Neat grid!
 - Custom Prismjs theme for &lt;code&gt; block syntax highlighting!
 - Greensock animating navbar sliding div!
 - Slick carousel with responsive breakpoints!
 - Almost no jQuery! (Slick needs it ðŸ˜•)
