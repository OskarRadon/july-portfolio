# Portfolio Site July Redesign
I figured my portfolio needed a redesign and my projects needed more descriptions so I re-built it from scratch!

## Technologies Used
Jade, SCSS, Greensock, Gulp & Node

Some cool features:
 - Flexbox-free grid layout on the main page, accomplished using float:left and calculating the width based on % values
 - Greensock animation, hopefully to inform and make UX novel/exciting
 - Probably going to refactor it to not use jQuery!
