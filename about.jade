			div.about-img
			p I’ve been pursuing web design and development since the days of MySpace, and earlier this year I  graduated from Epicodus, a fantastic dev bootcamp in downtown Portland. 
			p I’m passionate about building remarkable and innovative user experiences, and constantly learning new tools, techniques, libraries, and languages. 
			p When I’m not writing code, teaching myself something, or working in Sketch and Illustrator I like to bike, rock climb, read  sci-fi, paint, and draw. 
			p Send me an email if you want to work together on any projects!
